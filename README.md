MediKlaud - a hospital services management system for doctors, patients and hospital staff. 
â€ƒ
Introduction
JMI Hospital, a leading healthcare institution, is seeking a comprehensive software solution to streamline its operations and enhance patient care. As a Lead Software Engineer, I am assigned for this tasked with designing and developing a web-based platform to manage various aspects of the hospital's services, catering to doctors, patients, hospital staff.

Doctor Management
The system aims to facilitate efficient management of doctors affiliated with the hospital. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or designated personnel should be able to register doctors joining the hospital network. Each doctor is assigned a unique identifier, and their personal information such as name, contact details, specialty, and qualifications are recorded in the system. Doctors should be able to access the system to view their schedules, patient appointments, and relevant patient information.

Patient Management
The system should provide a seamless experience for patients seeking medical services at JMI Hospital. Front desk staff or registration clerks will use the system to enroll new patients, capturing essential details including name, contact information, address, and date of birth. Patients should have the ability to schedule appointments through phone calls. Upon booking, patients should receive confirmation notifications via email. 

Billing and Payment Management
The system should integrate billing and payment functionalities to streamline financial transactions related to medical services. It should generate accurate invoices for patients for doctor consultations. Moreover, the system should flag any outstanding bills to prevent patients from scheduling new appointments until previous dues are cleared.

Conclusion
In summary, the Hospital Services Management System aims to revolutionize the way JMI Hospital delivers healthcare services by providing a unified platform. By streamlining and prioritizing patient care, the system will empower JMI Hospital to achieve its mission of providing high-quality healthcare services to the community.
